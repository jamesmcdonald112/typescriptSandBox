- Once a variable is declared with a type in TypeScript, it cannot be reassigned a value of a different type. TypeScript enforces static typing, meaning the type of a variable is set when itâ€™s declared and cannot change throughout its scope. In contrast, JavaScript variables are dynamically typed and can be reassigned with values of different types.
- Type annotation in TypeScript allows you to explicitly declare the type of a variable. This is particularly useful when a variable is declared without an initial value (e.g., let count: number;), ensuring that it can only hold values of the specified type.
