- Synchronous code
    - One step at a time
    - Single Threaded
    - All the lines of code written in all the other files are Synchronous.

- Asynchronous
    - More than one activity running at the same time
    - Multithreaded.

- Javascript is single threaded, which is a limitation.
    - Impact of this limitation can be reduced using events or callbacks.

- A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation. There are three states:
    - Pending
    - Fulfilled: with a value
    - Rejected: with a response.
